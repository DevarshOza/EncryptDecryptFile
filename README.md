File Steganography Tool

This is a simple Bash script for hiding and extracting files within other files using basic steganography techniques. The tool allows you to hide one file inside another and extract the hidden file from a combined file.
Features

    Hide a File: Embed one file into another and create a combined output file.
    Unhide a File: Extract the hidden file from the combined file using the original cover file.
    Simple Menu: Easy-to-use command-line interface with a menu for selecting actions.

Requirements

    bash (tested with bash 5.0)
    figlet (for large text display)
    lolcat (for colorized output; optional)




Notes

    The cover file should be a valid file that can serve as a base for embedding another file.
    The hidden file can be of any type or size, but ensure it is smaller than the cover file.
